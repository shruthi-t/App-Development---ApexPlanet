Features Added:


1. Password Toggle
Description: Users can toggle the visibility of the password in the password input field.

How It Works:
A clickable eye icon is placed inside the password field.
Clicking the icon switches the password visibility between hidden and visible.
The icon dynamically changes based on the current state (visible or hidden).

2. Remember Me Functionality
Description: Allows users to save their username for future logins.

How It Works:
A checkbox labeled "Remember Me" is added.
If checked, the username is saved in shared preferences and automatically displayed in the username field on the next app launch.
If unchecked, the saved username is removed.

3. Input Validation
Description: Validates that the username and password fields are not empty before proceeding with the login.

How It Works:
When the "Login" button is pressed, the app checks both fields.
If any field is empty, a toast message notifies the user to fill in all fields.

4. Toast Message
Description: Provides feedback to the user upon successful login.

How It Works:
After successful validation, a toast message displays "Login successful," giving clear feedback.
